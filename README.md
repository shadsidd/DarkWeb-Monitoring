  2. Install and launch it
  3. Keep it running while using this tool

  - On macOS:
    ```bash
    brew install tor
    brew services start tor
    ```
  - On Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install tor
    sudo systemctl start tor
    ```
  - On Windows:
    ```bash
    choco install tor
    ```

Verify Tor is working:
```bash
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org/api/ip
```

### CLI Mode (darkweb_monitoring.py)

1. Ensure Tor is running (required)
2. Edit darkweb_monitoring.py to set your organization:
   ```python
   organization = "Your Organization Name"  # Change this line
   ```
3. Choose your LLM provider by uncommenting the appropriate model:
   ```python
   # Choose one of these:
   model=OpenRouter(id="meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free")
   #model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile")
